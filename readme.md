In this project, we developed machine learning models to classify texts as either student-written or generated by large language models (LLMs).
Using a dataset with an initial imbalance (3 LLM-generated texts vs. 1375 student-written texts), we augmented with additional LLM-generated data to balance the classes.
Our approach included deep learning, specifically a DistilBERT model, and traditional machine learning methods.
After training, DistilBERT achieved a validation accuracy of 97.45%, while non-neural models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Voting Classifier reached 99â€“100% accuracy, showing excellent performance.
This study highlights the efficacy of pre-trained embeddings and ensemble models in distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, providing a foundation for future advancements in automated text classification.
